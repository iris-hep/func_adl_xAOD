## Introduction

This allows you to query hierarchical data stored in a root file that has been written using the ATLAS xAOD format.
This code allows you to query that.

## Features

A short list of some of the features that are supported by the `xAOD` C++ translator follows.

### Python

Many, but not all, parts of the `python` language are supported. As a general rule, anything that is a statement or flow control is not supported. So no `if` or `while` or `for` statements, for example. Assignment isn't supported, which may sound limiting - but this is a functional implementation so it is less to than one might think.

What follows are the parts of the language that are covered:

- Function calls, method calls, property references, and lambda calls (and lambda functions), with some limitations.
- Integer indexing into arrays
- Limited tuple support as a means of collecting information together, or as an output to a ROOT file.
- Limited list support (in same way as above). In particular, the `append` method is not supported as that modifies the list, rather than creating a new one.
- Unary, Binary, and comparison operations. Only 2 argument comparisons are supported (e.g. `a > b` and not `a > b > c`).
- Using `and` and `or` to combine conditional expressions. Note that this is written as `&` and `|` when writing an expression due to the fact `python` demands a `bool` return from `and` and `or` when written in code.
- The conditional if expression (`10 if a > 10 else 20`)
- Floating point numbers, integers, and strings.

### xAOD Functions

You can call the functions that are supported by the C++ objects as long as the required arguments are primitive types. Listed below are special _extra_ functions attached to various objects in the ATLAS xAOD data model.

#### The Event

The event object has the following special functions to access collections:

- `Jets`, `Tracks`, `EventInfo`, `TruthParticles`, `Electrons`, `Muons`, and `MissingET`. Each function takes a single argument, the name of the bank in the xAOD. For example, for the electrons one can pass `"Electrons"`.

Adding new collections is fairly easy.

#### The Jet Object

Template functions don't make sense yet in python.

- `getAttribute` - this function is templated, so must be called as either `getAttributeFloat` or `getAttributeVectorFloat`.

### Math

- Math Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **
- Comparison Operators: <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
- Unary Operators: +, -, not
- Math functions are pulled from the C++ [`cmath` library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/): `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `acos`, `asin`, `atan`, `atan2`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`, `exp`, `ldexp`, `log`, `ln`, `log10`, `exp2`, `expm1`, `ilogb`, `log1p`, `log2`, `scalbn`, `scalbln`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `cbrt`, `hypot`, `erf`, `erfc`, `tgamma`, `lgamma`, `ceil`, `floor`, `fmod`, `trunc`, `round`, `rint`, `nearbyint`, `remainder`, `remquo`, `copysign`, `nan`, `nextafter`, `nexttoward`, `fdim`, `fmax`, `fmin`, `fabs`, `abs`, `fma`.
- Do not use `math.sin` in a call. However `sin` is just fine. If you do, you'll get an exception during resolution that it doesn't know how to translate `math`.
- for things like `sum`, `min`, `max`, etc., use the `Sum`, `Min`, `Max` LINQ predicates.

### Metadata

It is possible to inject metadata into the `qastle` query to alter the behavior of the C++ code production. Each sub-section below has a different type of metadata. In order to invoke this, use the `Metadata` call, which takes as input stream and outputs the same stream, but the argument is a dictionary which contains the metadata.

A few things about metadata:

- No two metadata blocks can have the same name and different content. However, it is legal for them to have different dependencies. In that case, the multiple blocks are treated as a single block with a union of the dependencies.
- Exceptions (`ValueError`) are raised if the dependency graph can't be completed, or a circular dependency is discovered.

#### Method Return Type

If you have a method that returns a non-standard type, use this metadata type to specify to the backend the return type. There are two different forms for this metadata - one if a single item is returned, and another if a collection of items are returned.

For a _single item_:

| Key | Description | Example |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------|
| metadata_type | The metadata type | `"add_method_type_info"` |
| type_string | The object the method applies to, fully qualified, C++ | `"xAOD::Jet"` |
| method_name | Name of the method | `"pT"` |
| return_type | Type returned, C++, fully qualified | `"float"`, `"float*"`, `"float**"` |
| deref_count | Number of times to dereference object before invoking this method (optional) | 2 |

Note: `deref_count` is used when an object can "hide" hold onto other objects by dereferencing them (e.g. by overriding the operator `operator*`). If it is zero (as it mostly is since `operator*` isn't often overridden), then it can be omitted.

For a _collection_:

| Key | Description | Example |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------|
| metadata_type | The metadata type | `"add_method_type_info"` |
| type_string | The object the method applies to, fully qualified, C++ | `"xAOD::Jet"` |
| method_name | Name of the method | `"jetWeights"` |
| return_type_element | The type of the collection element | `"float"` |
| return_type_collection | The type of the collection | `vector<float>`, `vector<float>*` |
| deref_count | Number of times to dereference object before invoking this method (optional) | 2 |

#### Event Level Collections

CMS and ATLAS store their basic reconstruction objects as collections (e.g. jets, etc.). You can define new collections on the fly with the following metadata

For _atlas_:

| Key | Description | Example |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------|
| metadata_type | The metadata type | `"add_atlas_event_collection_info"` |
| name | The name of the collection (used to access it from the dataset object) | `"TruthParticles"` |
| include_files| List of include files to use when accessing collection | `['file1.h', 'file2.h']` |
| container_type | The container object that is filled | "'xAOD::ElectronContainer'" |
| element_type | The element in the container. In atlas this is a pointer. | `"xAOD::Electron"` |
| contains_collection | Some items are singletons (like `EventInfo`) | `True` or `False` |

For _cms_:

| Key | Description | Example |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------|
| metadata_type | The metadata type | `"add_cms_event_collection_info"` |
| name | The name of the collection (used to access it from the dataset object) | `"Vertex"` |
| include_files| List of include files to use when accessing collection | `['DataFormats/VertexReco/interface/Vertex.h']` |
| container_type | The container object that is filled | "'reco::VertexCollection'" |
| element_type | The element in the container. In atlas this is a pointer. | `"reco::Vertex"` |
| contains_collection | Some items are singletons (like `EventInfo`) | `True` or `False` |
| element_pointer | Indicates if the element type is a pointer | `True` or `False` |

#### Include Files

Any include files listed will be added to the top of the `query.cpp` file that is generated. While ordering is maintained within a single `Metadata` query here, it is not maintained between different `Metadata` calls.

All includes are done with straight quotes:

```C++
#include "file1.hpp"
#include "file2.hpp"
```

| Key | Description | Example |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------|
| metadata_type | The metadata type | `"include_files"` |
| files | List of files to include. | `["file1.hpp", "file2.hpp"]` |

### Output Formats

The `xAOD` code only renders the `func_adl` expression as a ROOT file. The ROOT file contains a simple `TTree` in its root directory.

- If `AsROOTTTree` is the top level `func_adl` node, then the tree name and file name are taken from that expression. Only a sequence of python `tuples` or a single item can be understood by `AsROOTTTree`.
- If a `Select` sequence of `int` or `double` is the last `func_adl` expression, then a file called `xaod_output.root` will be generated, and it will contain a `TTree` called `atlas_xaod_tree` with a single column, called `col1`.
- If a `Select` sequence of a `tuple` is the last `func_adl` expression, then a file called `xaod_output.root` will be generated, and it will contain a `TTree` called `atlas_xaod_tree` with a columns named `col1`, `col2`, etc.
- If a `Select` sequence of dictionary's is the last `func_adl` expression, then a file called `xaod_output.root` will be generated, and it will contain a `TTree` called `atlas_xaod_tree`, with column names taken from the dictionary keys.

`ServiceX` (and the [`servicex` frontend package](https://pypi.org/project/servicex/)) can convert from ROOT to other formats like a `pandas.DataFrame` or an `awkward` array.

## Testing and Development

Setting up the development environment:

- After creating a virtual environment, do a setup-in-place: `pip install -e .[test]`

To run tests:

- `pytest -m "not atlas_xaod_runner and not cms_aod_runner"` will run the _fast_ tests.
- `pytest -m "atlas_xaod_runner"` and `pytest -m "cms_aod_runner"` will run the slow tests for ATLAS and CMS respectively that require docker installed on your command line. `docker` is involved via pythons `os.system` - so it needs to be available to the test runner.
- The CI on github is setup to run tests against python `3.7`, `3.8`, and `3.9` (only the non-xaod-runner tests).

Contributing:

- Develop in another repo or on a branch
- Submit a PR against the `master` branch.

In general, the `master` branch should pass all tests all the time. Releases are made by tagging on the master branch.

Publishing to PyPi:

- Automated by declaring a new release (or pre-release) in github's web interface

### Running Locally

Designed for running locally, it is possible to setup and use the `xAOD` backend if you have `docker` installed on your local machine. To use this you first need to install the local flavor of this package:

```bash
pip install func_adl_xAOD[local]
```

You can then use the `xAODDataset` object or the `CMSRun1AODDataset` object to execute `qastle` running on a docker image for ATLAS or CMS Run 1 AOD, locally.

- Specify the local path to files you want to run on in the arguments to the constructor
- Files are run serially, and in a blocking way
- This code is designed for development and testing work, and is not designed for large-scale production running on local files (not that that couldn't be done).

When something odd happens and you really want to look at the C++ output, you can do this by including the following code somewhere before the `xAOD` backend is executed. This will turn on logging that will dump the output from the run and will also dump the C++ header and source files that were used to execute the query.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger("func_adl_xAOD.common.local_dataset").setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

- In general, the first two lines are a good thing to have in your notebooks, etc. It allows you to see where warning messages are coming from and might help when things are going sideways.
